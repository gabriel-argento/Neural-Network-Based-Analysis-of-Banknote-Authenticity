# Neural Network-Based Analysis of Banknote Authenticity
This project explores the application of Kohonen's Self-Organizing Map (SOM)—an unsupervised artificial neural network—for the analysis and clustering of data to identify patterns in genuine and counterfeit banknotes.

The primary goal is to investigate the SOM's ability to distinguish between authentic and fake banknotes without prior knowledge of their labels, assessing its effectiveness as a technique for monetary fraud detection.
